         <h1> The Maps </h1>     
          <br><br>
         <p> Sometimes there are more than one versions of a given map. You should use the latest; the one with the greatest version number. Older ones most likely have a bug or a misfeature that has educed the necessity for a new version. Unfortunately there currently is no way to remove the old buggy maps from the automated hosts, so just refrain from using them for the time being. List of bad maps
        Setting the map and using spawn boxes with Autohosts. <br><br>

        Typing in full map names when using Autmatic hosts on Internet play can be tricky. Thus it is easier to go with the maps’ numerical id, because it is shorter, has no spaces/underscores in it nor is it case-sensitive. Line under every map name is an Autohost command to type or paste into the Battleroom window.
        <br><br>
        Only the game host can make and modify the spawn boxes, which is the recommended way for start positions (Game option: Start position type: choose-in-game). Thus when using an Autohost, one must provide the correct commands for the Autohost to set the startboxes up accordingly.
        <br><br>
        The following is the most prevalent setup. <br>
        Define two definite sides, for use with 1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, 4vs4, etc: <br>
        <code>!split v 20 </code>(Vertical, with areas on the west and east sides of the map)<br>
        <code>!split h 20 </code>(Horizontal, with areas on the north and south sides of the map)<br>
         The number ’20’ above is the width of the corresponding box areas in percentages of the whole map. <br>

        For 4-way FFA, this is usually the best:<br>
        <code>!corners a 20</code><br><br>

        For 3-way FFA, it’s a bit tricky, since all of the 3 boxes must be manually defined one by one. For this reason there are good defaults noted down on 3-way FFA capable maps below. Before using any of the !addbox commands, run a !clearbox
        Downloading the maps<br><br>

        Maps are “.sd7” or “.sdz” files. To install those files, move them into (Unix) “˜/.spring/maps” or (Windows) “My Documents\My Games\Spring\Maps”. Use the “Reload maps/games” option from the “Tools” menu in SpringLobby.
        Maps that have been made or customised for Spring:1944<br><br>

        The following list has been sorted by map area with increasing order. New players are encouraged to start out with the smaller maps first, those are easier to learn with. Note that the images of map textures do not represent relative size in themselves, you should take notice of the “Size:” parameter.<br>
